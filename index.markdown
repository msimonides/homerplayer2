## Features
- simple interface, large buttons,
- reads book titles aloud
- flip-to-stop: put device screen down to pause playback
- adjust controls: volume, chapter skip, forward, rewind
- kiosk mode: create a single-app dedicated device
- adjust speed: slow down playback for those hard of hearing
- sleep timer

The project is currently at a very early stage, it is far from polished and some functionality is likely to change.

**The app will be available soon on the Play Store.**

## Single application/kiosk mode

With the kiosk mode enabled the user's actions are confined to the application and no other functions of the device are available. There is no way to exit the app.

This way a tablet can be converted into a simple to use, single purpose audiobook player. The other functions of the device don't become a distraction to the user.

### Kiosk installation steps

The kiosk mode requires special installation steps.

**Instructions will be published here within the next few days**
