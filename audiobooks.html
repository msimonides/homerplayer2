<h3>Getting audiobooks</h3>

<p>
Homer is just a player application, it does not provide any audiobooks. You need to load them yourself.
</p>

<p>
The app supports DRM-free audio files - files without copy protection.
Most common audio formats are supported: MP3, M4A, M4B, AAC and many others. There is no support for
DAISY but you can copy MP3 files from most DAISY audiobooks to Homer Audio Player.
</p>

<p>
You can get DRM-free audiobooks from:
<ul>
    <li>online stores - in most cases books that you buy (as opposed to subscriptions) don't use DRM,</li>
    <li>libraries - access and medium (CDs, online) varies by country, check your local library,</li>
    <li>public domain sites - e.g. <a href="https://librivox.org">Librivox</a>,</li>
    <li>MP3 CDs - they contain MP3 files that can be copied to a device with Homer, they may be available
        in libraries and stores, but nowadays are less popular.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The <code>r/audiobooks</code> community on Reddit has a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/audiobooks/wiki/_/wiki/sources/">longer list of suggestions</a>.
</p>

<h3>Folders and naming</h3>

<p>
Homer reads audiobooks only from folders that are added in the application. It doesn't use the
system media library.
</p>

<p>
You can add and remove audiobooks folders when first launching the app or later in settings.
</p>

<p>
Homer lists top-level files and folders in the browse view.
Audiobooks with multiple files should be placed in a folder, their files will be played in alphabetic order.<br>
An audiobook folder may contain subfolders, they will be played in alphabetic order too. This is useful when
a book comes on multiple CDs where file numbers repeat between CDs.
</p>

<p>
The image above shows structure for a folder "My Audiobooks" that contains four audiobooks.<br>
If there are multiple audiobooks folders, their contents is merged into a single browse list.
</p>

<h4>Tips on naming</h4>
<p>
The application uses folder and file names to display audiobooks in the browse screen and reads them when TTS is enabled.
Therefore it's important to use good names for a good user experience.
</p>

<ul>
<li>agree upon a consistent pattern with the user, e.g. "author - title",</li>
<li>test how titles are pronounced by the TTS in your language,</li>
<li>experiment with different punctuation: <code>-</code>, <code>;</code>, <code>,</code> and <code>.</code>
    will each produce a different pause,</li>
<li>balance length and descriptiveness: shorter names are faster to browse.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Transferring files</h3>

<p>
You can manage the audiobooks (move into folders, rename etc.) with a file manager app on the device where
Homer is installed. It's usually more convenient to organize the files on a laptop and then move them to the
device.
</p>

<h4>Copying from a PC or Mac via USB cable</h4>

<p>
Connect your laptop with a USB cable to the phone or tablet with Homer installed.<br>
On Windows open File explorer, navigate to "This computer", the connected device will be shown there.<br>
On Mac you'll need an app:
<a href="apps.apple.com/us/app/macdroid-manager-for-android/id1476545828">MacDroid</a>
and <a href="https://www.android-file-transfer-mac.com">Android File Transfer</a> are often recommended.
</p>

<p>
When connecting for the first time you may need to grant permission and/or select file transfer:
</p>
<img src="assets/img/usb_connection_notification.webp" width="280">

<ol>
<li>Make sure the screen is on and the device unlocked.</li>
<li>Disable kiosk mode if enabled.</li>
<li>Connect the USB cable.</li>
<li>If asked to allow file access, agree.</li>
<li>Check the notifications tray for USB connection mode. Select "File transfer" if needed.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Remote management with a cloud storage service</h4>

<p>
You can use a cloud storage service to synchronize an audiobooks folder on the device and manage the contents
remotely.<br>
You'll need to choose the storage service (Dropbox, Google Drive etc. or even something more specialized
like Syncthing) and set it up.
</p>

<p>
Once configured this can be very convenient. There are however a few things to consider:
</p>

<ul>
<li>the user needs an Internet conneciton, obviously,</li>
<li>audiobooks can take quite a bit of space on the shared drive,</li>
<li>it may use a bit more battery for WiFi or mobile network to be enabled.</li>
</ul>
