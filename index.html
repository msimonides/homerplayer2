Homer is an <b>audiobook</b> and <b>podcast</b> player designed for the elderly and visually impaired.<br>
With Homer you can repurpose an Android tablet to an easy to use dedicated player for audiobooks and podcasts.
</p>

</lite-youtube>

<p>
In a typical scenario one person (e.g. a caregiver, a library assistant) will set up Homer, install content,
lock down the device and hand it over to the user.<br>
The user can then listen to books and podcasts with a simple user interface. With the lock down mode enabled
they don't need to worry about inadvertantly changing settings, switching to another app or otherwise
"breaking" the device.
</p>

<h3>Main features</h3>

<ul>
<li>large and simple interface,
<li>reads book titles while browsing,
<li>flip-to-stop: place the device with screen down to pause playback,
<li>minimal set of features, no problematic functions like shuffle,
<li>plays audiobooks and podcasts,
<li>rich customization and configuration options,
<li>kiosk mode: lock down the app to make a dedicated device,
<li>sleep timer, playback speed and more.
</ul>
