<p>
In a typical scenario one person (e.g. a caregiver, a library assistant) will set up Homer, install content,
lock down the device and hand it over to the user.<br>
The user can then listen to books and podcasts with a simple user interface. With the lock down mode enabled
they don't need to worry about inadvertantly changing settings, switching to another app or otherwise
"breaking" the device.
